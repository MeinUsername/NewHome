#Reminder

The file that I am using is a file that I have extracted from the files on:
[Schweizer Haltestellen/Swiss public transport stops](http://www.bav.admin.ch/dokumentation/publikationen/00475/01497/index.html?)


I have extracted just the names and the relativ GIS coordinates.

From this file I have to extract all the files "interesting stops".
Previously I have used a bounding box method e.g. I have looked up the coordinates of that upper left corer and the lower right corner stops and extracted all between.
Before I have queried the open data API for the SBB server [OpenData API](https://transport.opendata.ch)
